# Deployment

## Git and Git Hub

To begin my project I set up a repoistory in GitHub.

**git init** was the initial command I used in the terminal to initialise the git repository

**git add .** was then used to add the latest small change in my code to the staging area.

**git commit -m'message'** was then used immediatley after "git add ." to note the change in the staging area .

**git push** was the final command used to load the local commit to the main repository.
